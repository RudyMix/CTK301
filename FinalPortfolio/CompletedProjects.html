          <p>Night Crawl is the second game that I worked on at Illinois State University for the Game Development club. Over the spring semester, we created a short and simple roguelike game which focuses on a kid fighting off the monsters of their dreams such as werewolves, trees, clowns, and lions. The game is procedurally generated, so it required us to create a plethora of rooms for each stage. I contributed to some of the rooms in the forest section of the game and had a great time doing it.

          <h2>Rusted Vengeance</h2>
          <img class="Rusted" src="RustedVengeance.png" alt="Rusted Vengeance Image">
          <p>Rusted Vengeance was the first game that I worked on at Illinois State University for the Game Development club. Over the period of a semester, we created a steampunk RPG with fighting game elements that focuses on a robot taking down corruption. We met for several hours each week and all worked on the things related to our roles in the club and eventually created a game out of it. This is the first fully developed game that I worked in a team with. I wrote almost all of the sidequests present in the game and I am quite proud of it.
