        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>I have been experimenting with making music recently and while I am just starting out, I would like to make more in the future. Samples to be uploaded soon.</p>
        <h2>Video Essays</h2>
        <p>Recently, I have been writing a lot more analytical content, but it never feels fully appropriate for a static medium. Video essays are something that I have gotten quite into over the past couple years and I want to explore the medium and make my own content for it, likely focusing on story writing and game design.</p>
        <h2>Artwork</h2>
        <p>I do dabble with a sketchbook sometimes, so art will likely be uploaded once I can find some time to make any or find any of my old sketchbooks.</p>
        <h2>Games</h2>
        <p>Right now I am not working on any games at the moment but I will be once the fall arrives. Then, I will be working on multiple games at once.</p>
        <h2>Fiction Writing</h2>
        <p>Writing fiction has been one of my favorite passtimes and as I hope to work as a narrative designer (the role of writing games) in the video game industry, it seems fitting that I should put some of my stories on here. So as they are created and revised for the public eye, I will put my writings here.</p>
        <h2>This Website</h2>
        <p>As of the moment I do plan to keep up with this website (adding pages and more content) as it does function as a useful way to collect all the projects (personal or otherwise) that I make and I can have a wide enough selection that it will eventually feel like a time capsule for a different era of my life.</p>
