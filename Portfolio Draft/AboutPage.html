            <h2> I am Rudy Mix </h2>
            <p> I was born in Hoffman Estates, IL and since my childhood, have dreamed of making things for the world to see. When I was younger, I would spend hours upon hours writing countless stories and never really stopped. I also had a deep passion for games, whether they be tabletop or electronic or a mix of the two. With this combination, I should have figured that I would always end up doing something with games, especially writing them. Currently, I am a freshman at Illinois State University studying game design and having the time of my life doing what I love, making entertainment. </p>
